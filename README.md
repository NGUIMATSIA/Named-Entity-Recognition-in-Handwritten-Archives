# Named Entity Recognition in Handwritten Archives

This project is part of the Socface project, which aims to leverage handwritten census data between 1836 and 1936 to analyze social changes over a 100-year period. The specific goal is to use natural language processing models to automate named entity recognition in these archives.

## Project Contents

- **Source Code:** The source code of our implementation is available in the `notebook` folder. You'll find in it five notebooks, one of them corresponding to the descriptive analysis we have done and others to models we have trained. The name of each notebook correspond to the model concerned. 

  
- **Data:** The data used in this project is available in the `data` folder. 
- **Report:** The detailed report of our study, including a task presentation, data description, model analysis, and explanation of our experiments and results, is available in the `report` folder.
